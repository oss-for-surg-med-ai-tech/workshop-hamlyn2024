We are happy to share recordings of our exceptional lineup of speakers this year at the Hamlyn Symposium Workshop on Open-Source Software for Surgical Technologies 2025.
This workshop highlighted the profound impact of open-source software in advancing surgical technologies and medical innovation.

* Xenophon Papademetris (Yale School of Medicine) discussed Medical Software, Regulation, and Related Challenges.
* Kevin Cleary (Children's National Hospital) provided a Historical Perspective on Open-Source Software for Medical Robotics and Imaging, highlighting lessons learned for managing open-source projects.
* Sonia Pujol and Colton Barr (Harvard) presented on Open-Source Neuronavigation for Low-Resource Healthcare Settings.
* Andres Diaz-Pinto (NVIDIA) introduced MONAI Label, an open-source tool for image labeling and learning.
* Mikael Brudfors (NVIDIA) showcased Accelerating AI Medical Device Streaming Workflows with NVIDIA Holoscan.
* Shashank Sharma (Karl Storz VentureONE) spoke on Enabling Software-Defined Medical Robotics Using Open-Source Software.
* Andrew Wichmann (Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures) explored Commercial Open-Source Software.
* Micha Pfeiffer (National Centre for Tumor Diseases, Dresden) delved into Software-Driven Computer-Assisted Navigation in the Age of Deep Learning.
* Tamas Haidegger (Óbuda University) discussed Open-Source Software Supporting Product Development: Sustainability versus Certification.

A big thank you to all the authors who submitted posters this year!
